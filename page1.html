            <h2>GitHub Workflow</h2>
            <p><b>GitHub</b> is a platform that helps people solve problems by building software together. It's an online service that uses <b>Git</b> to provide code repositories. 
                <br/> Repositories are like a project's folder, containing all of the project files and revision history. They can have multiple collaborators and can either be public or private.
                <br>Here is a link to a page describing the <a href= "https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/"> GitHub flow </a></p>
            <p><i>What is a commit?</i>
                <br/>A commit is an individual change to a file, for example when you add code to a branch.</p>
            <p><i>What is a branch?</i>
                <br/>A branch is an alternate timeline where you can safely make changes to the software. It's a parallel version of a repository.
                <br/>This allows you to work freely and make commits without affecting the "live" or master branch.</p>
            <p><i>What is a pull request?</i>
                <br/>Pull requests let you show others the changes you are proposing so they can review and discuss them, before merging them with the master branch.</p>
