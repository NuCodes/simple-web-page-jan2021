            <h2>Git Version Control</h2>
            <p>In order to expand my programming skills, I have used Git version control to manage to creation of this updated simple web page.</p>
            <p>The first thing I did was to create a new local repository and link it to a new remote repository in GitHub. To do this I also cloned my existing 'Simple Web Page' repository from GitHub, so I could work on and improve the pages I had created previously. The following screenshots show this process:</p>
            <img src="pictures/cli-screenshot-1.png" alt="A screenshot showing Command Line Interface.">
            <img src="pictures/cli-screenshot-2.png" alt="A screenshot showing Command Line Interface.">
            <img src="pictures/cli-screenshot-3.png" alt="A screenshot showing Command Line Interface.">
            <img src="pictures/cli-screenshot-4.png" alt="A screenshot showing Command Line Interface.">
            <img src="pictures/git clone screenshot 1.png" alt="A screenshot shoing Git Clone">
            <img src="pictures/git clone screenshot 2.png" alt="A screenshot shoing Git Clone">
            </br>
        </div>

        <div>
        <p>I also wanted to tidy up the pictures into one folder, which I hadn't managed to achieve last time, and so the screenshot below shows this process:</p>
        <img src="pictures/CLI screenshot moving index creation of picture folder.png" alt="A screenshot showing the moving of files using CLI">
        <p> I used the command 'mv' to move the individual picture files into the newly created folder, for example 'mv gummy-app-development.png' followed by the approproate file path.</p>
