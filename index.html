            <h1>Week 1 @ The Developer Academy</h1>
            <p>I originally started my journey on the <a href="https://thedeveloperacademy.com/part-time-bootcamp/"> Part Time Bootcamp </a> at <b>The Developer Academy</b> on Tuesday 6<sup>th</sup> October 2020.
            <p>I have now re-started the course, as of Tuesday 19<sup>th</sup> January 2021, and I'm making improvements to my original <a href="https://nucodes.github.io/simple-web-page/">Simple Web Page</a> mainly by spliting the content into seperate pages and adding navigation, plus using Git version control and the Unix shell to manage the creation of this new page.</p>
            <p>This link shows the original <a href="https://github.com/NuCodes/simple-web-page.git">GitHub Repository</a> </p>
